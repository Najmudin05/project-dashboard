## Conclusion
Sales show a declining trend from 2009 to 2011, with a slight increase in 2012, indicating a need for a more consistent sales strategy. Technology products are the main contributor, accounting for 38.21% of total sales, which could be a primary focus for the company.

The average sales per order reached 131,635, providing an opportunity to increase this through strategies like upselling. The order completion rate is relatively high (89.14%), but 10.79% of orders were returned, indicating a need for improvements in quality or customer satisfaction.
